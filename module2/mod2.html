			<p class="p1">
				Nothing beats the heat on a blazing summer's day like a cooling ice cream. Ice cream consists of cream slowly stirred in a churn to freeze it to a creamy consistency. Gelato uses a milk base instead of cream and has less air mixed into it than ice cream. Frozen custard uses a cooked base of egg yolks. Frozen yogurt uses yogurt rather than the heavier cream base of ice cream, which reduces calories.

			<h2 class="head2">Pie</h2>
			<p class="p2">
				The simplest form of pie involves a crust with a filling. The crust can be on the top and bottom or just the bottom, made from pastry or graham cracker crumbs. Pie fillings include custards, puddings, nuts and fruits. Chocolate cream pie, lemon meringue pie, shoo-fly pie, pecan pie, apple pie and tarts are just some pie variations. Tarts use a baking pan with straight sides and don't have a top crust.

			<h2 class="head3">Cakes</h2>
			<p class="p3">
				 Cakes are not just for birthday parties. These desserts resemble tender, sweet breads. Examples of cakes include angel food cake made with egg whites, sponge cake, flourless cakes like the sachertorte, German chocolate cake, pavlova cake made with a meringue base, pound cake and fruitcake. Petits fours, cupcakes and snack cakes are single-serve sizes of larger cakes.
